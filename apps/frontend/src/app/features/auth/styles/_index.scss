/**
 * Auth Styles Barrel File
 *
 * @description Forwards all shared auth SCSS partials as a single entry point.
 * Components import via `@use '../../styles' as *` to get all variables,
 * mixins, and shared styles without namespace prefix.
 *
 * @architecture
 * Uses the modern SCSS module system (@use/@forward) instead of deprecated @import.
 * Order matters: _auth-shared must come first as _animations depends on its tokens.
